# ClassRoom-BookingSystem
A Classroom Booking system is a Mini Project that we choose for our group towards the partial fulfilment of the subject System Programming Technology II (NMT12704). The code is written in the Python programming language while the Tkinter library is used for the GUI to make it interactive and SQLite3 is used for the database.<br/>
## Introduction
* This is a preliminary classroom booking system.<br/>
* Developed using Python library, Tkinter as front and SQLite3 for database management.<br/>
* User friendly, effective and saves user time in searching for a room.<br/>
* Alternative for the manual processing of booking for a room.<br/>
<br/>“Class Booking System” refers to a booking system for students and lecturers that can use for reservation management. This system is available for 24 hours, allowing users to book the class whether it is morning or night. Users can easily make classroom reservations using this system for discussions or additional classes. Additionally, it will also make it easier for the students to use the classroom for indoor activities or group discussions. By lowing the cost for lecturers and students to call the management to check on class availability, this approach also reduces the possibility of mistakes because the traditional way of booking system is using a pen and paper. <br/>
## Features
* Log in
* register
* Add user details
* Book a room
* Cancel booking <br/>
<br/>Our Class Booking System provides a platform for lecturers as well as students, where users can check all the class that are available at a specified date and time. The users must fill in some details on the login area, then it will shows the option to book a class, where on clicking the drop-down arrow user can see all the rooms available and the user may also cross check with the time slots in which a room his/her choice is available. The users can login and check all the bookings that have been made from his /her login details. In the unfortunate scenario where a scheduled class needs to be cancelled, the lecturers or even the students can use the portal to cancel the booking since the room is no longer required. By doing this, we can vacate the room for the faculty which requires it.
